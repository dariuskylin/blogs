<h2 class="content_h2">分析</h2>
<p>题意是：现有一个整形数组，数组的第i个元素表示第i天某只股票的股价；在允许多次交易（在买前必须卖出手里所有的股票）的前提下，求最大收益。</p>
<p>
    这道题目是“<a href="../../../2013/11/03/leetcode-Best-Time-to-Buy-and-Sell-Stock.html">Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</a>”的扩展，但是更简单，只因题目已经设置了限制条件：在买前必须卖出手里有的股票。要获得最大收益，只需买入最多次的股票，而每次卖出都希望能收益：可以看出这个题目符合贪心策略。
